# Frontend authentication login 
this is an authentication login component made with Reactjs and Typscript. It's easy to play with and easy to adjust to your needs.
This app is connected to my own api, that you can see here: [authentication-api-backend](https://github.com/Gondrak08/authentication-api/tree/master)
## What you can do 
You can registrate a new account clicking in the "registration" button, or realizing the login clicking in the "email" button. 
Google and Facebook validation was not implemented until this moment.
