# Frontend authentication login 
This is an authentication login component made with Reactjs and Typescript. It's easy to play with and easy to adjust to your needs. <br>
This webapp is connected to my own api. You can see find that here: [authentication-api-backend](https://github.com/Gondrak08/authentication-api/tree/master)
## What you can do with it
You can registrate a new account clicking in the "registration" button. <br>
